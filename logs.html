                       We have been coding a lot of changes in the flight control, including new PID control code and security measures for in-flight risks. With new code to be tested, we decided to use the date from the receiver and visualize it using ground control station (GCS) system in simpler terms 3d model environment, before testing it in real life.

                       After testing the flight on 26th, <span class="user-name">Rajas</span> started testing the PID with roll stabilization as the first priority. Mounted on the testing stand, with 10 percent throttle, the ironflake started oscillating, and the PID control system, wasn't working out. With gains and factors tested out, we decided to work on the code again, so that we can stop oscilations.<br>

                    <p><span class="user-name">Sahil</span> â€” Today at 10:58 PM: This is the bill of the above mentioned items which mentions the amount 810. The item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is not mentioned as it was purchased after obtaining Microchip and cuz we didn't check while buying The cost of the item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is 30/- INR.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-name">Sahil</span> â€” Today at 11:06 PM: As of now <span class="user-name">Swar</span> will be testing a few parts from the above mentioned list which include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arduino Nano (1)</li>
                        <li>Joystick Module (1)</li>
                        <li>Port B to USB cable (1)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span class="user-name">Rajas</span> has the remaining parts. He has posted a photo suggesting that the parts need to be cleaned up using "rubbing alcohol". I am "assuming" that he will be doing it by himself as I haven't received any update on it by him at the moment of writing this message.</p>
