          During several motor run tests the holder broke while going into the hovering phase, causing a new design change to cover the stress on certain
          points on the 3d printed parts. With the new design printed a sturdy and efficient motor holder were swapped in place of the old ones.
          Along with that ESP32, was soldered on the receiver module. The new ESP32 has more storage and energy capacity helping for more commands
          to run.
