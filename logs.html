           We have been coding a lot of changes in the flight control, including new PID control code and security measures for in-flight risks.
           With new code to be tested, we decided to use the date from the receiver and visualize it using ground control station (GCS) system in simpler terms 3d model environment, 
           before testing it in real life.

           <span class="user-name">Swar Churi</span> proposed a new website design, with an interactive model of Ironflake as the main attraction.
           With some great visuals for photo gallery and log updates. The new website will be more minimal, and COOL.

            Mounted on the testing stand, with 10 percent throttle, the ironflake started oscillating, and the PID control system, wasn't working out.
            With gains and factors tested out, we decided to work on the code again, so that we can stop oscilations.<br>

          A vc was conducted today,  the topics discussed are:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The problem with NRF24L01 module with antenaa: The modules of transmtitter and receiver were replaced, as the
                NRF24l01 module with antenna wasn't transmitting data.<span class="user-name">Rajas Naik</span> then swapped the module with SMD module with
                antenaa which was placed in the reciever.</li>
            <li>The purchase of BLDC motor: The team needs to contribute for the money which will be needed to buy the motors. In
                total 2 motors need to be purchased, and everyone will try and find motors with the required specs and budget.</li>
            <li>Design of the VTOL: <span class="user-name">NR</span> and <span class="user-name">Sahil Karpe</span> will be looking at the designing of the vtol as well as the marterial. They
                will collaborate with one another for the same.</li>
          </ul>
          Another vc will be held tomorrow to discuss the purchase of BLDC Motors.

          <span class="user-name">Rajas Naik</span> with the help of <span class="user-name">NR</span>'s and <span class="user-name">Swar Churi</span>'s code has succesfully tested the working of servo. The transmitter is
           giving the instructions properly while the receiver is capturing the movements of the server and showing proper output.
           The servo was wirelessly controlled using NRF24L01!

          <ol>
          <li>Arduino Nano (2)</li>
          <li>NRF24 with antenna (1)</li>
          <li>NRF24 without antenna (1)</li>
          <li>Joystick module (2)</li>

          </ol>
          <span class="user-name">Sahil Karpe</span> â€” Today at 10:58 PM: This is the bill of the above mentioned items which mentions the amount 810. The
          item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is not mentioned as it was purchased after obtaining Microchip and cuz we
          didn't check while buying The cost of the item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is 30/- INR. <span class="user-name">Sahil Karpe</span> â€” Today at 11:06
          PM: As of now <span class="user-name">Swar Churi</span> will be testing a few parts from the above mentioned list which include:
          <ul>
          <li>Arduino Nano (1)</li>
          <li>Joystick Module (1)</li>
          <li>Port B to USB cable (1)</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="user-name">Rajas Naik</span> has the remaining parts. He has posted a photo suggesting that the parts need to be cleaned up
          using "rubbing alcohol". I am "assuming" that he will be doing it by himself as I haven't received any update
          on it by him at the moment of writing this message.
