                       We have been coding a lot of changes in the flight control, including new PID control code and security measures for in-flight risks. With new code to be tested, we decided to use the date from the receiver and visualize it using ground control station (GCS) system in simpler terms 3d model environment, before testing it in real life.

                       After testing the flight on 26th, <span class="user-name">Rajas</span> started testing the PID with roll stabilization as the first priority. Mounted on the testing stand, with 10 percent throttle, the ironflake started oscillating, and the PID control system, wasn't working out. With gains and factors tested out, we decided to work on the code again, so that we can stop oscilations.
